## Hi there 👋 I'm Asam

### About Me
***
A JavaScript junkie with a genuine passion for the industry as a whole. most of my experience is in React, but I'm always exploring other frameworks and technologies to ensure I'm up to date in this industry.

Day to day I am working with React, react-native, GatsbyJS, Firebase and Netlify.

I understand the importance of self learning and staying current in this ever changing environment and thrive off the challenge that brings.
